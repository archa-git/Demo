            <h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
            <p> Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.<br> Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture.<br> Jackson influenced artists across many music genres. <br>Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated street dance moves such as the moonwalk, which he named, as well as the robot.<br>
            <br>From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle.<br> In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. <br>The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges.<br> The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson . <br>Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales estimated around 500 million records worldwide.[nb 2] <br><br>He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (fourth highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades.<br> His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". <br>Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (making him the only recording artist to be inducted) and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.
